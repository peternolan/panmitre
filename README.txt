This application was built as a take home project for MITRE.

In order to run the code, go into the "panmitre" folder, and
execute the command "node server.js"

This will execute the code. The code will need a few seconds to complete.
Please wait for the code output to end.

When it is completed, go to localhost:8080 to view the results of the code.
The names will appear on the screen.

Thank you!
